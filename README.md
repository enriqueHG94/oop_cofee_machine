# **Coffee machine**
This project is a simulation of a coffee machine that can prepare different types of drinks, such as latte, espresso or cappuccino, and accept payment in coins.
## **Requirements**
To run this project you need to have Python 3.9 or higher installed.
## **Installation**
To install this project, just clone the repository from GitHub:

git clone https://github.com/enriqueHG94/oop_coffee_machine.git
## **Usage**
To start the program, run the main.py file from the terminal:

python main.py

The program will show you the available drink options and ask you to choose one. It will then tell you how much the drink costs and ask you to insert coins. If you have paid enough, it will prepare the drink and give you your change back. If not, it will give you your money back and ask you to choose again.
